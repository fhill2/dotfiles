# When using a display manager, these environment variables might not be loaded, as the login shell can be skipped, and the window manager is run instead.
# When using startx/initx (current setup), login shell is always executed

# note ~/.profile is only run when entering a sh login shell, or a bash login shell without any user bash init files existing in the home folder (.bash_profile)
# zsh doesn't ever run ~/.profile, it only runs ~/.zprofile
# when setting environment variables here, the systemd user environment is not updated with these changes
