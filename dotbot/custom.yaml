# why I have forked certain dotbot plugins:

# dotbot-rust - installs with cargo install --force by default (upgrades on every run) - I want this as an option
# dotbot-sudo broken: with dotbot installed through yay or pip --user, dotbot-sudo looks for dotbot binary at /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/bin/dotbot, or ~/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages, and the binary is not located there

# why I am not using certain dotbot plugins:
# dotbot-pacaur - it does install official and aur packages fully automated, however it requires pacaur to be installed to install AUR packages first.
# the included dotbot-pacaur bootstrap script is broken, and there are no reliable pacaur bootstrap scripts available that I've found (oct 2022)
# therefore - using dotbot-yay + 

# dotbot-yay -> opens a subshell and performs yay --needed for every package - very slow
# dotbot-paur -> is a dotbot-yay fork with the cmd changed - very slow



# i3 scripts

# # some programs need installing and then some extra post setup
# # remember: yay --needed does not work correctly (does not detect if a package already exists)
